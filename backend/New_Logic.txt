OK SO 





BILL KE MODEL M EK PROPERTY H TOTAL AMOUNT JO UPDATE KRTA REH RHA HU , SO THAT KHI AUR BILL ko access kru kisi aur controller m toh baar baar aggregate function na lgana pde


PRODUCT CONTROLLERS - WHAT ARE THEY DOING ?

-> addProduct 
- First user must be logged in , protect middelware check krega ye , and if user is logged in , send user data with req.user 
- Second check if user doesnt have activeBill property as null , If it is return bad auth response
- Ye active bill null na ho ye bill ke controllers dekh rhe -> for more clarity check createActiveBill controller ka logic issi .txt file m 
- Anyway if active bill is not null , I did 6 things 
-------- 1) CREATE NEW PRODUCT DOC IN DATABASE WITH bill_id prop as currentBill bill_id
-------- 2) GET CURRENT ACTIVE BILL FROM DATABASE -> basically findById
-------- 3) GET TOTAL COST OF ALL THE PRODUCTS PRESENT IN BILL , and add current cost price of current product to that (check if there were no products present before what will i get)
-------- 4) UPDATING AND SAVING TO DATABASE TOTAL AMOUNT PROPERTY OF BILL and push newProduct to products property of bill
-------- 5) EMIT THE EVENT to notify clients that a product was added

-> getAllProducts 
-> When it will be called ? This will be called multiple times (from client side) , whenever any product is added or removed
- First user must be logged in , protect middelware check krega ye , and if user is logged in , send user data with req.user 
- Second check if user doesnt have activeBill property as null , If it is return bad auth response 
- Anyway if active bill is not null , do these things
---------- 1) CHECK IF DATABASE IS NOT EMPTY -> IF IT IS SEND DIFFERENT response
---------- 2) GET CURRENT BILL DOCUMENT -> SO THAT I CAN SEND BACK total_amount property of currentBill back as well with other data
---------- 3) GET PRODUCTS GROUPED BY BILL AND QUANTITY (AGGREGATE) -> THIS IS CRUCIAL (HERE I AM STRUCTURING HOW I AM GOING TO REPRESENT THIS AGGREGATED DATA)
------- Basically all the products belonging to my current_bill id should be grouped together , and laterwards they should be grouped together again in such a way that there are no duplicate documents , Quantity property is added here to represent occurence of documents with same "unique_id" 
---------- 4) SEND BACK THIS AGGREGATED RESULT





----> Workflow goes like this
-> 1. User logs in / signs up
-> 2. We send OTP to user
-> 3. User verifies OTP
-> 4. We send back JWT token as cookie to user
-> 5. User sends JWT token in headers to access protected routes
-> 6. If user is logged in (can access protected routes) -> We check if user has active bill or not
-> 7. If user has active bill -> We send back response saying user has active bill
-> 8. If user does not have active bill -> We create active bill for user , and save it in req.user.activeBill
-> 9. After user has valid active bill -> User can add products / getAllProducts / delete products etc 
-> FIXED MAJOR ISSUE IN CREATE ACTIVE BILL

--> Basically , i was doing findByIdAndUpdate() on active bill , and i was finding the bill document based on req.user._id . If user wants to create a new bill , but it has already created one bill in the past , then our query will rewrite older bill . and we will loose previous bill instance . Basically ek hee bill document pe kaam hoga hr baar.
--> To fix this , i am creating new bill , if and only if activeBill property is null and user is logged in and updating user with new bill id. Otherwise , i will return req.user.activeBill.






-> RAN INTO SOME PROBLEM REGARDING addProduct controller and protect middleware before it
-> PROBLEM : 
--> It slipped out of my mind that i need , req.user for proper functioning of addProduct controller
--> Since esp32 is only sending product details , i need to get the user details somehow
--> esp32 wont be able to pass protect middleware as it doesnt have jwt token 
--> To provide esp32 with jwt token or user details , i need to create full duplex communication between esp32 and backend

-> SOLUTION: 
--> I created a new doc in DB for current user , which will be updated at the time of login and logout only
--> This doc will contain the currently logged in user id and thats it
--> It is similar to State model , as there will be only one doc in this collection
--> When i logout i delete this doc , and when i login i create this doc
--> This doc will be used by addProduct controller to get the user details
---->I created new middleware , addProductProtect , which will be used by addProduct controller
--> It's logic is based on the current user doc , if it exists then it will pass the control to next middleware

CONS:
->CURRENTY LOGGED IN USER ID IS STORED IN PLAIN TEXT , WHICH IS NOT SECURE
->I am not ok with using doc to implement authentication , i will change it in future
